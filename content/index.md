# TODO

- [ ] Customize theme ([GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll), [Quartz layout docs](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/layout))
- [x] Configure a custom domain ([GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), [Quartz docs](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting#custom-domain))
- [ ] Maybe transfer content from my old blog
- [ ] Why is the default layout on desktop appearing as mobile?
