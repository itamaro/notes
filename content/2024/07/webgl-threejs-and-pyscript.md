I rewatched [≈Åukasz Langa](https://lukasz.langa.pl/)'s PyCon talk, [Build in-browser 3D experiences with WebGL and PyScript](https://youtu.be/Af9DwG0WF24) (after watching it live in-person). Watching the recording and having my laptop on hand allowed me to try it out myself, which is quite fun!

≈Åukasz conveniently has the projects available on [his pyscript.com profile](https://pyscript.com/@ambv), making it pretty easy to ~~steal~~ reproduce his demos üôÉ (https://pyscript.com/@itamaro)

1. Using raw WebGL - a static triangle: https://itamaro.pyscriptapps.com/raw-webgl-static-triangle/latest/
2. Making the triangle from above "animated": https://itamaro.pyscriptapps.com/raw-webgl-animated-triangle/latest/
3. Using three.js - a float through the cubiverse: https://itamaro.pyscriptapps.com/cubiverse-float/latest/
