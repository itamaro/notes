All the recordings from [PyCon US 2024](https://us.pycon.org/2024/) are now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS) ðŸŽ‰

In related news, 70+ videos were added to my YouTube watch list ðŸ˜¬

I worked through the [[beeware-tutorial|BeeWare tutorial]] - that was a fun one!

Also did the PyO3 tutorial (https://github.com/itamaro/pyo3-tutorial), and [[creative-coding-with-python-pyp5js|creative coding Py5 tutorial]].
